# Ofili formula

A 12-year old Nigerian boy has made a new discovery in the field of mathematics. 
The boy, Chika Ofili, has found a new formula to test for the divisibility of 7.

According to Mary Ellis, Ofili's teacher and the Mathematics head at Westminster 
Under School where Ofili attends, Ofili discovered the formula while doing his holiday
homework contained in a book called First Steps for Problem Solvers. The book has several
divisibility tests. These can be used to quickly determine whether an integer is divisible
by a given number without leaving any remainders. For example, to determine if a number is 
divisible by 10, check if the last digit is 0. However, the book had no divisibility test 
for 7. 

Not to be deterred, Ofili came up with a formula and backed it up with algebraic proof. 
In his formula, you take the last digit of any whole number, multiply it by 5 and then add 
it to the remaining part of the number to get a new number. If this new number is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
